# DST-ML-EkNN

This is a smart clustering method which relies on metric learning eg. Neighbourhood Component Analysis (NCA) to solve class imbalanced data problem. To know about it, please follow the link: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-3514-7_26. Cite our paper, if you are using it in your research work.

Important !!!!!

Caution: only files with *.arff extensions are used in this program.

Method of evaluation:  We have used F-Score for evaluation purposse.

You have to provide training and testing datasets seprately. 

First, execute NCA_Transformation.py to transform these datasets.

After that, execute DST_ML_EkNN.java over these transformed files.

Use, Java 9 and Python 3.6 with Eclipse IDE for execution.
