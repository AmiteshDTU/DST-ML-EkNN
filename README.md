# DST-ML-EkNN: Data Space Transformation with Metric Learning and Elite k-Nearest Neighbor Cluster Formation for Classification of Imbalanced Datasets

This is a smart clustering method which relies on metric learning eg. Neighbourhood Component Analysis (NCA) to solve class imbalanced data problem.

Caution: only files with *.arff extensions are used in this program.

Method of evaluation:  We have used F-Score for evaluation purposse.

You have to provide training and testing datasets seprately. 

First, execute NCA_Transformation.py to transform these datasets.

After that, execute DST_ML_EkNN.java over these transformed files.

Use, Java 9 and Python 3.6 with Eclipse IDE for execution.
