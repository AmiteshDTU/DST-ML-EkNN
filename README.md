# DST-ML-EkNN:Data Space Transformation with Metric Learning and Elite k-Nearest Neighbor Cluster Formation for Classification of Imbalanced Datasets

Most of the real-world datasets suffer from the problem of imbalanced class representation, with some classes having more than sufficient samples, while some other classes are heavily underrepresented. The imbalance in the class distributions of the majority and minority samples renders conventional classifiers like the k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier ineffective due to the heavy bias toward the majority class. In this paper, we propose to counter the class-imbalance problem by data space transformation of the training set by distance metric learning prior to an enhanced classification phase. The classification phase comprises of partitioning the set of k-Nearest Neighbors of each transformed test sample into two clusters based on their distances from the two extreme members in the set. A majority voting of the training samples within the ‘Elite’ cluster that is closest to the  transformed test sample indicates the label of the test sample. Our proposed method is called Data Space Transformation with Metric Learning and Elite k-Nearest Neighbor cluster formation (DST-ML-EkNN). Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets using a variety of metric learning methods, with comparisons to the state of the art, establish the supremacy of our learning approach for imbalanced datasets.
